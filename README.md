## üìñ Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing data related to drug safety and pharmacovigilance. By examining clinical trial records, we aim to understand trends, address data challenges, and support decision-making in the healthcare and pharmaceutical sectors.

Key areas of focus:
- **Clinical Trial Data**: Comprehensive analysis of records, including title, status, interventions, and sponsors.
- **Terminology Insights**: Definitions of common pharmacovigilance terms like *Clinical Study*, *Observational Trial*, *Principal Investigator*, *Sponsor*, *Intervention*, and *Enrollment*.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Leveraging univariate and bivariate analysis techniques to extract meaningful insights.
- **Missing Data Handling**: Identifying and addressing high percentages of missing values in features like "Acronym" and "Study Results."

## ‚ú® Key Findings

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Clinical Trial Landscape**
- Dataset contains **5,783 records** of drug safety and pharmacovigilance trials.
- **Top Statuses**: 
  - "Recruiting" status leads with **2,095 trials**.
  - "Not yet recruiting" follows with **1,224 trials**.
- **Trial Phases**:
  - "Recruiting" trials dominate across multiple phases, with the "Unknown" phase being the most common.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Time Series Trends**
- A significant increase in trials after **2019**, reflecting intensified research efforts post-COVID-19 pandemic.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Geographical Distribution**
- **Top Countries by Trial Count**:
  - United States: **1,287 trials**.
  - France: **647 trials**.
  - United Kingdom: **585 trials**.
- Countries with fewer trials tend to have higher missing data percentages in features like "Acronym."

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ **Missing Data Insights**
- High percentages of missing data in features such as "Acronym," "Study Documents," and "Results First Posted."
- Imputation techniques explored:
  - **Missing indicator** for categorical variables.
  - **Median imputation** for numerical features.

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ **Bivariate Analysis**
- Relationships between variables like study status and trial phase reveal:
  - **"Recruiting" trials** span multiple phases.
  - The "Unknown" phase is most common within recruiting trials.

## üîç Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### **Univariate Analysis**
- Examines individual variables to understand distributions and frequencies.
- Highlights the prevalence of "Recruiting" trials.

### **Bivariate Analysis**
- Investigates relationships between features, e.g., study status vs. trial phase.

### **Time Series Analysis**
- Tracks trends in trial initiation over time, identifying spikes in research activities.

### **Location Analysis**
- Analyzes country-level data to map global research efforts and collaborations.
